# Bus Buddy

Bus Buddy is a lightweight web app to track who supervised each school bus trip.
It keeps a clear monthly balance, highlights coverage swaps, and works well on
phones and desktops.

## Features
- Log morning/afternoon trips with notes and holiday exclusions.
- Track the monthly balance and see who is ahead.
- Review all logged days and remove entries when needed.

## Usage
Open `index.html` in a browser. If your preview tool expects a `public/` folder,
open `public/index.html` instead. Data is stored locally in your browser storage.
